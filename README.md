This project is going to be a chatbot with the implementation of LLMs using Hugging Face interface.
Idk whatelse to say :D

Ok general gist:
- We're gonna make a general chatbot of sort (this can be changed to a different topic ofc)
- Two folders, LLM and frontend (the website)
- I'll have you work on implementing the python code for the LLM, Ms. ExpertPythonDeveloper
- There's gonna be some GitHub best practice things I'll have to somehow explain to you/demonstrate?

If github doesn't work out, than we can try something called VSCode live(?) which is like working with a shared Word/Google doc

If there's C/C++ stuff, I can work on that/try to
